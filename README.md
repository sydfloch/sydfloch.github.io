Hi! My name is [Sydney Floch](www.linkedin.com/in/sydney-floch-153947291), and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I am an open-minded, engaged and news-oriented student majoring in journalism and minoring in psychology. Storytelling is an imperative aspect to all our lives; I would love to connect and discuss it can unite us.

## Where do students come from to attend Lehigh? 

To many, Lehigh is considered a "Northeast" school, assuming that the majority of undergraduate students come from New England and the Tri-State area. Is this true? Utilizing data from [Lehigh's Office of Institutional Data,](https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/data.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2024.pdf) it turns out that approximately one third of the undergraduate student body is from other states -- not just Pennsylvania, New Jersey or New York. Conversely, 6.7% of students come from outside of the United States to attend Lehigh.
