## Where do students come from to attend Lehigh? 

To many, Lehigh is considered a "Northeast" school, assuming that the majority of undergraduate students come from New England and the Tri-State area. Is this true? Utilizing data from [Lehigh's Office of Institutional Data,](https://data.lehigh.edu/sites/data.lehigh.edu/files/LUprofile_2024.pdf) it turns out that approximately one third of the undergraduate student body is from other states -- not just Pennsylvania, New Jersey or New York. Conversely, 6.7% of students come from outside of the United States to attend Lehigh. This graphic was created using Canva.

## Americans' Trust in AI

Artificial Intelligence has become integrated into several aspects of American life: academics, the workforce, and entertainment. [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/) conducted research, published in 2023, detailing survey results from 11,201 American adults. Trust in AI has decreased as time goes on in all aspects of the data shown below. Pew Research Center shows that the expression of more concern than excitement has increased over 15% from 2021-2023. Displayed excitement also decreased from 18% to 10% over the three years.
