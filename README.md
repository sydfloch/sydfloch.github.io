Hi! My name is [Sydney Floch](www.linkedin.com/in/sydney-floch-153947291), and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I am an open-minded, engaged and news-oriented student majoring in journalism and minoring in psychology. Storytelling is an imperative aspect to all our lives; I would love to connect and discuss it can unite us.
